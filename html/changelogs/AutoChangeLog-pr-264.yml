changes:
  - rscadd: Added the waddle quirk, put a little pep in your step.
  - rscadd: Added the technobabble emote, with special sounds for anyone wearing NERD
      suits.
  - balance: Both screaming and the technobabble emote deal oxygen damage now, to
      prevent you from spamming them. On the upside, if you do spam screaming the
      sounds can overlap.
