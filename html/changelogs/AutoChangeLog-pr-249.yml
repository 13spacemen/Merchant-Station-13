changes:
  - rscadd: Added the Reagent Forge and assorted weapons such as the Mace or Hammer.
      Depending on which reagent you used, the weapons will have a different trait.
  - rscadd: Added the Material Manipulator, that lets you add multiple traits from
      a reagent to an already forged weapon, so you can have an acidic explosive sharp
      radioactive sword.
  - rscadd: Added all the machines to the active maps. It's left of atmospherics on
      Metastation, in the construction area on icebox, above the chapel on Kilo and
      above hydroponics on Deltastation.
